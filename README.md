### How to build:

1. Install the simple build tool ([SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/)). 
You will need version 0.12.0 of [sbt-launch.jar](http://repo.typesafe.com/typesafe/ivy-releases/org.scala-sbt/sbt-launch/0.12.0/sbt-launch.jar). 
Follow the [installation instructions](http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html#manual) on the SBT website.

2. Run `sbt test` to run the test suite.
